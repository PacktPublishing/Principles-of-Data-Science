## About the Book
Need to turn your skills at programming into effective data science skills? Principles of Data Science is created to help you join the dots between mathematics, programming, and business analysis. With this book, you’ll feel confident about asking—and answering—complex and sophisticated questions of your data to move from abstract and raw statistics to actionable ideas.
##Instructions and Navigations




The code will look like the following:
```
tweet = "RT @j_o_n_dnger: $TWTR now top holding for
Andor, unseating $AAPL"
words_in_tweet = first_tweet.split(' ') # list of words in tweet
```

This book uses Python to complete all of its code examples. A machine (Linux/Mac/Windows OK) with access to a Unix-style Terminal with Python 2.7 installed is required. Installation of the Anaconda distribution is also recommended as it comes with most of the packages used in the examples.
